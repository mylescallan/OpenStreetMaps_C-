## Install and Build IO2D then CppND-Route-Planning-Project

### Update 08/25/2023 (see Point 5.)

_______________


_macos 10.15.5 Beta (19F53f) using COREGRAPHICS_MAC to compile IO2D_ 

1. Create a folder that you are going to use for the project. Then, in _Terminal_ (or _iTerm_), change directory to that folder and clone the project files:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project.git --recurse-submodules
    ```
2. `cd` to `thirdparty` folder, then clone the _IO2D_ files:
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl
    ```
3. Follow IO2D instructions: https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md - which are
  - Download the extra C++ standard library headers from https://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/clang+llvm-6.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz and  add the  flags below so that these libraries can be found by IO2D:
  - REASON: _"Xcode currently comes with an old version of libc++ which lacks many of C++17 features required by IO2D. The easiest solution is to download a fresh build of libc++ from here. Export appropriate CXX and LD flags to make clang use this version of the standard library **(replace NEWPATH with a path of extracted archive contents** [in both of the following statements - i.e. 3 places])"_:
    ```
    export CXXFLAGS="-nostdinc++ -isystemNEWPATH/include/c++/v1"
    export LDFLAGS="-LNEWPATH/lib -Wl,-rpath,NEWPATH/lib"
    ```
    For example, if the path to that expanded folder of library headers is `/Users/myles/Work/Cpp/clang+llvm-6.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin` then those statements become:
    ```
    export CXXFLAGS="-nostdinc++ -isystem/Users/myles/Work/Cpp/clang+llvm-6.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/include/c++/v1"
    
    export LDFLAGS="-L/Users/myles/Work/Cpp/clang+llvm-6.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib -Wl,-rpath,/Users/myles/Work/Cpp/clang+llvm-6.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib"
    ```
  - Install libpng: `brew install libpng`
  - Install cmake: `brew install cmake`
4. Edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file _(".../P0267_RefImpl/CMakeLists.txt")_, commenting out the section relating to samples
    ```
    # COMMENT OUT: Relating to Samples
    #if( NOT DEFINED IO2D_WITHOUT_SAMPLES )
    #	add_subdirectory(P0267_RefImpl/Samples)
    #endif()
    ```
  - From: https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project/issues/1
    _"A small trick is to edit the CMakeLists.txt under P0267_RefImpl and comment out the part with samples. Then, using CoreGraphics/Mac on macOS run "ALL_Build" and "install" in XCode."_
  - ![comment_out](./images/comment_out.png)
5. **Important:** _This step was updated 08/25/2023_ `--config` in the previous version was not a valid flag _(in previous versions of **cmake** invalid flags were ignored, now **they throw an error**)_
    
    `cd` to `P0267_RefImpl` (in `thirdparty`) - in _Terminal_:
    ```
    mkdir Debug && cd Debug
    cmake -G "Xcode" Debug "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" -DIO2D_DEFAULT=COREGRAPHICS_MAC ../.
    open io2d.xcodeproj
    ```
    _(in the previous version, the middle step was `cmake -G "Xcode" --config Debug "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" -DIO2D_DEFAULT=COREGRAPHICS_MAC ../.` containing **the invalid** flag)_
6. In XCode:
  - Build "ALL_BUILD"
  - Build "install"
  - ![build io2d](./images/IO2D_BUILD.gif)
7. IO2D is now ready to be used. `cd` to the root of the project files
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
  - ![build osm](./images/OSM_build.gif)
8. Complete
  - ![run osm](./images/OSM_run.gif)

### Additional Steps (To Complete Project Using Xcode)

1. To get the project up and running in XCode, I created a new build folder in the root directory of the project (which I called `buildX`)
    ```
    mkdir buildX && cd buildX
    cmake -G Xcode ..
    ```
2. Then, in XCode, I opened the `.xcodeproj` that was generated _(`OSM_A_star_search.xcodeproj`)_:
    ```
    open OSM_A_star_search.xcodeproj
    ```
  - ![buildX](./images/buildX.gif)
3. **Note:** You will have to change the paths to your map XML file(s) to make this build (in both `main.cpp` and `utest_rp_a_star_search.cpp` (the test file): 
  - ![mapX](./images/mapX.gif)

## Important

If you build this project locally, you may find that the test fails. **Try your code in the workspace**. For some reason, in some cases, running the test locally fails but passes in the workspace _(I posted a `Knowledge` question about this but didn't get an explanation for why this happens. I will dig deeper, if I find a reason then I will update this to explain why)._

For example, my code works in the workspace, but locally:
